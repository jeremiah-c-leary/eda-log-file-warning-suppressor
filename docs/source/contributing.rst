Bug Reports
###########

If you run into anything that is not handled correctly, please submit an issue.
When creating the issue, use the **bug** label to highlight it.
Fixing bugs is prioritized over feature enhancements.

Code Base Improvements
######################

My Python journey is never ending and I learn new things with each project.
I run the code through *Codacy* and *Code Climate*, and they are very helpful.
However, I would appreciate any suggestions to improve the code base.

Create an issue and use the **refactor** label for any code which could be improved.

Feature Requests
################

Let me know if there is anything I could add to make ELFWS easier to use.
Create an issue with the **enhancement** label.

New Vendor Warning Suppresssions
################################

I plan to update ELFWS as I run into tools where I need to suppress warnings.
If there is a tool that is currently not supported, then create an issue with the **Vendor Tool** label.

Provide a small sample showing the format of the warnings and I can add it or show you how to add it.
